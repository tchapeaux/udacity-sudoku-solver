sudoku-solver
=============

Made for Udacity CS258 Course on Software Testing.

Put on GitHub because there are not enough sudoku solver in the world.

How to use it
=============
- Run "python solve_sudoku.py" to look at some examples
- Run "python solve_sudoku.py filename" to solve a specific sudoku (where filename is a file containing the grid (column separated by whatever, lines sparated by carry return))
- Run "test_random.py" to launch random tests

I have no idea how titles works
===============================
... But I love you.

While my solution is a simple backtracking, it is a straight computation upgrade from the proposed solution.
